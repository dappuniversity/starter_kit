### Things to add in the future

- I would like to implement a backend database in node.js for buyer/seller profiles.
  - This would allow buyers to see all of their orders.
  - Store shipping information if desired for quicker purchasing.

- I would like to flesh out the purchasing process where:
  - When a buyer makes a purchase, a page will display for shipping instructions.
  - This address can then be sent to the seller for shipping
