# crypto-marketplace

## What is it

- A decentralized application deployed on the ethereum test blockchain called Kovan Test Network.
- A decentralized marketplace where anybody with an ethereum wallet on metamask can list items for sale.
- Used solidity language to implement smart contracts to:
  - create listing of an item to be sold.
  - purchase the item on the marketplace using ethereum.
- Constructed client side in ReactJS with bootstrap and styled-components libraries.

### What technologies, languages and libraries were used

- Solidity
- JavaScript
- ReactJS
- Bootstrap, reactstrap
- Styled-components
- Web3
- Chai
- Axios
- Truffle
- Ganache
- MetaMask

### Things to add in the future

- I would like to implement a backend database in node.js for buyer/seller profiles.
  - This would allow buyers to see all of their orders.
  - Store shipping information if desired for quicker purchasing.

- I would like to flesh out the purchasing process where:
  - When a buyer makes a purchase, a page will display for shipping instructions.
  - This address can then be sent to the seller for shipping
